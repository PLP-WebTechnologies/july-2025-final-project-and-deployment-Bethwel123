                "Second Law",
                "Third Law",
                "Law of Gravitation"
            ],
            answer: 0,
            explanation: "The First Law states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force."
        },
        {
            question: "What does F=ma represent?",

            ],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: "F=ma is the mathematical representation of Newton's Second Law, showing the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration."
        },
        {
            question: "When a rocket launches, the action is the rocket pushing gases downward. What is the reaction?",
            options: [
                "The gases pushing the rocket upward",
                "The rocket moving sideways",
                "The ground shaking",
                "There is no reaction"
            ],
            answer: 0,
            explanation: "This demonstrates Newton's Third Law - for every action (gases pushed down), there is an equal and opposite reaction (rocket pushed up)."
        },
        {
            question: "Which scenario best demonstrates Newton's First Law?",
            options: [
                "A book sitting on a table",
                "A car accelerating when the gas pedal is pressed",
                "A swimmer pushing water backward to move forward",
                "A balloon releasing air and flying around the room"
            ],
            answer: 0,
            explanation: "The book remains at rest (demonstrating inertia) until an unbalanced force acts on it."
        },
        {
            question: "If you double the force applied to an object while keeping its mass constant, what happens to its acceleration?",
            options: [
                "It doubles",
                "It halves",
                "It stays the same",
                "It quadruples"
            ],
            answer: 0,
            explanation: "According to F=ma, acceleration is directly proportional to force when mass is constant."
        },
        {
            question: "Which of these is NOT an action-reaction pair?",
            options: [
                "A person pushing a wall and the wall pushing back",
                "Earth's gravity pulling on you and your gravity pulling on Earth",
                "A book pushing down on a table and the table pushing up on the book",
                "A car accelerating forward and air resistance pushing backward"
            ],
            answer: 3,
            explanation: "These are opposing forces but not action-reaction pairs because they act on the same object (the car)."
        },
        {
            question: "What is inertia?",
            options: [
                "The tendency of an object to resist changes to its motion",
                "The force that causes objects to fall",
                "The energy an object has due to its motion",
                "The product of mass and acceleration"
            ],
            answer: 0,
            explanation: "Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its velocity."
        },
        {
            question: "If a 10 kg object is accelerating at 2 m/s¬≤, what is the net force acting on it?",
            options: [
                "5 N",
                "12 N",
                "20 N",
                "0.2 N"
            ],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: "Using F=ma: 10 kg √ó 2 m/s¬≤ = 20 N."
        },
        {
            question: "Why do passengers lurch forward when a car stops suddenly?",
            options: [
                "Because of inertia - their bodies tend to keep moving forward",
                "Because of gravity pulling them forward",
                "Because of the car's deceleration creating a forward force",
                "Because of the seat belts not working properly"
            ],
            answer: 0,
            explanation: "This demonstrates inertia - the passengers' bodies tend to maintain their state of motion."
        },
        {
            question: "Which statement about action-reaction forces is TRUE?",
            options: [
                "They act on the same object",
                "They are always equal in magnitude",
                "They always cancel each other out",
                "They are the same as balanced forces"
            ],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: "Action-reaction forces are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, and act on different objects."
